# Program Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for our JavaScript program. This documentation provides insights into the structure, components, and installation process of the program.

## Program Structure

The main program is located inside the `usr` folder. Inside the `usr` folder, you will find the following subfolders and files:

1. **bin**: This folder contains binary files that are self-generated and compiled during the installation process.

2. **icon**: The `icon` folder stores icons used by the program for various purposes.

3. **node_modules**: This folder appears after the installation process and contains dependencies required by the program.

4. **src**: The `src` folder contains the main GUI (Graphical User Interface) files for the program.

5. **storage**: This folder is reserved for future features such as saving and restoring chat data.

6. **Vendor**: The `Vendor` folder contains submodules from GitHub repositories in their raw form, used for compiling without modification.

7. **Dockerfile**: The `Dockerfile` is used for Docker setup, although it may not be adapted for this version and remains in its raw form from the main branch.

8. **docker-compose**: Similarly, the `docker-compose` file may not be adapted for this version.

9. **electron-builder.yml**: Currently, this file is not being used in the program.

10. **index.js**: The `index.js` file contains the main logic of the program.

11. **package-lock.json**: This file appears only after running the installation process and contains information about the specific versions of dependencies installed.

12. **package.json**: The `package.json` file determines the required dependencies and their versions for the program.

## Installation Process

To install and run the program, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the root repository directory.

2. Run the `run.sh` script.

The installation process will begin automatically, and the program will be set up with its dependencies.
